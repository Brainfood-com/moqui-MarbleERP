# Moqui Marble ERP

Moqui Marble ERP is a planning and management application for businesses that produce goods and services, and sell to individuals (B2C) and organizations (B2B). 

This is a comprehensive ERP application rather than being focused on goods like POP Commerce ERP or services like HiveMind PM & Admin. Part of the reason for the combination is that goods oriented businesses also have projects and tasks to manage even if they don't sell them, and services oriented businesses also have equipment and supplies to manage even if they don't sell goods.

Moqui Marble ERP is designed around business activities in 3 categories by the primary roles in the system: Internal, Supplier, and Customer. These activities fit into high level business processes such as Produce to Pay (Supplier interactions) and Order to Cash (Customer interactions), and are combined to support a complete end to end flow.
